However, I am lucky enough to be born as a Singaporean, in Singapore, with ready access to technology and the internet in my growing years. But I guess what is more interesting to you is that I have built numerous companies and sold two of them. At least 2 companies so far have crossed a million dollar in annual revenue. One of them has reached ~$10M in annual revenue.</p><p>And I did them bootstrapped, as a broke solo founder. What I have instead of capital when I was starting out is an innumerable amount of failures and an absurd grit. For which I’d seek to document them down in this blog.</p><hr><p>This blog is dedicated to my children and their offspring, as I attempt to chronicle my expertise and experience in my wealth-building ventures. So hello, my darling children :)</p><p>I grew up without a significant role model in my life. My mother tried her best in the sense that I was born in Singapore; I had clothes on me, food on the table, and a roof over my head, so I consider that a win. My father was absent and just a bad person through and through. I learned almost everything through books and by trying to mirror what society deems to be normal or well-adjusted. I don’t think my circumstances are unique. So, this goes out to everyone else who lacks proper parents but wants to learn. This is for you as well.</p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><nav class="footer__nav"><ul></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://x.com/nubela" aria-label="X"><svg><use xlink:href="https://nubela.me/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg></a></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://nubela.me/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://nubela.me/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
