            "content_html": "<p>It sucks to write this, but it has been almost a month since I launched NinjaPear, and yet I don’t think any single customer has integrated NinjaPear yet. Obviously, NinjaPear does not have any product market fit (PMF). This is, therefore, an introspective piece to tear down why NinjaPear sucks, and what I need to do next to inch towards PMF. This is the first of a series of PMF blog posts for NinjaPear, as there will be multiple iterations before we finally make a PMF breakthrough.</p><p>But before I begin tearing down NinjaPear at its current state, I think it is better that I set up a PMF framework.</p><h2 id=\"solving-for-pmf-framework\">Solving For PMF Framework</h2>\n<p>The way to construct the framework is to answer the following questions:</p><ul>\n<li>Who is the <em>target audience</em>?</li>\n<li>Where can I find a community of this audience for which I’m able to <em>reach out to them individually, at scale</em>, to convert them to the product?</li>\n<li>What <em>problem</em> is my product solving?</li>\n<li>How will I make my <em>first $100/mo</em>?</li>\n<li>What is the one secret that I have that allows me to <em>radically differentiate</em> my product from the others?</li>\n<li>What is the <em>one-line pitch</em> that I can send to my audience/mailing list that will immediately intrigue them to try out the product?</li>\n<li>Who would be the competitor that I want to beat?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I should also add that this PMF framework is intended for bootstrappers, like I have always been. So caveats apply if you’re trying to apply this as a VC-funded company.</p><h2 id=\"prior-hypothesis\">Prior Hypothesis</h2>\n<p>The current iteration of NinjaPear is based entirely on the hypotheses that:</p><ol>\n<li>There should be a <em>better</em> free version of a live chat service compared to Tawk.to. Better in the sense that it is AI-first. And more free.</li>\n<li>That a free version of Intercom would be enticing.</li>\n<li>That a single subscription for multiple customer-communication products would be enticing enough.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These hypotheses were made due to the following false assumptions:</p><ul>\n<li>That <em>free</em> is a strong magnet. – I don’t think it is. I think it cheapened the product and makes people doubt it.</li>\n<li>That a single subscription is a killer proposition – I think it’s a bonus for Enterprise sales, but it is not a groundbreaking pitch.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With Proxycurl, I was able to say something along the lines of:</p><blockquote>\n<p>Hey, I have an API that would allow you to scrape and enrich 1M LinkedIn profiles, want to try?</p></blockquote>\n<p>But with NinjaPear, I realised I just wasn’t able to craft an email with a persuasive top-line pitch. That is when I realised I got the pitch and angle for NinjaPear wrong.</p><h2 id=\"constructing-the-pmf-framework\">Constructing the PMF Framework</h2>\n<p>I have to work backwards. Let’s start with my personal constants:</p><ol>\n<li>I do not need to build a billion-dollar business, nor do I intend to publicly list the company.</li>\n<li>I can keep going for 10 years without making money, as long as I do not lose money.</li>\n<li>I have a domain that has good domain reputation.</li>\n<li>I have an email list of my past customers, with whom I hold a good reputation.</li>\n<li>I can code; I can perform marketing; I can do sales.</li>\n<li>I am rather creative when it comes to product design.</li>\n<li>I have taste.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Then, let’s consider the constants of the customer support and communication industry. What will not change about the customer support industry in 10 years’ time:</p><ul>\n<li>Human customers will still want to talk to <strong>humans</strong> for support.</li>\n<li>Human customers will still want <strong>quick</strong> support.</li>\n<li>Companies will always consider customer support as a <strong>cost centre</strong>.</li>\n<li>Companies like Amazon which invest in excellent customer support are rare and will continue to be rare.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are also different categories of customer support needs:</p><ul>\n<li>Urgent recovery – Eg, when a company’s bank account gets closed, and the CEO wants to reach out to someone in the bank with decision-making abilities as soon as possible.</li>\n<li>Payment matters – Eg, when I need to return an item I purchased and have it refunded.</li>\n<li>Technical support – Eg, I want to ask questions about the API, but I’m not able to find the relevant information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I came up with these follow-up thoughts and questions during brainstorming:</p><ol>\n<li>Customers usually don’t like to pay for support. Businesses consider support a cost centre and will do what they can to minimize the cost.</li>\n<li>I was very focused on the platform of support and constrained myself to considering customer support solutions for the website only. Maybe I should consider where the users are (social media? on the software itself? offline?)</li>\n<li>What can I offer that will wow a business and make it give NinjaPear a try immediately? I guess it has to be an offer with a time constraint.</li>\n<li>Businesses want to invest first in growth, then in retention. Everything else is <em>not</em> that important. So ideally, the product should try to solve the problems of growth or retention for a business, since it makes for a far easier sell.</li>\n<li>I also realised historically, the products that I launch and that take off have a developer-oriented angle to them.</li>\n<li>I also started thinking deeper into problems that the customer support niche tries to solve:<ul>\n<li>Would it be channels? For which a company has to support multiple channels of communication with the customer?</li>\n<li>Would it be ease of support, for which a company tries to optimize how fast a human agent can respond to a ticket.</li>\n<li>Would it be accuracy and outcome of support, for which a company tries to solve a ticket as fast as possible?</li>\n<li>Would it be in scaling human agents, for which a company tries to spend as little as possible to support as many customers as possible? (Rare, because there are only so few big tech companies. Most companies rarely have <em>that</em> many tickets a day. For example, Proxycurl, a 10M ARR company, had maybe 20-50 a day, which is not that many.)</li>\n<li>Would it be in ease of deployment? For which we try to help a customer deploy customer support solutions as quickly as possible?</li>\n<li>Would it be in sorting out tickets so that human agents don’t waste that much time on spam, and/or getting tickets to the correct person as fast as possible?</li>\n<li>Would it be in tracking tickets, for which technical tasks are associated with customer support tickets and having them replied to as soon as the technical tasks are completed?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>As for the target market, I’d be inclined to focus on SMBs and startups.</li>\n<li>As for the solution, I’d like it to be something that can grow into the Enterprise category with reputation and refinement, even if I were to focus on SMBs at the beginning of the journey.</li>\n<li>I also want to ideally solve boring, age-old customer-support/communication problems, instead of AI/greenfield products.</li>\n<li>I want a competitor to fight/role model against.</li>\n<li>Don’t do AI please. Too many competitors and it’s not a boring problem.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"honing-the-pitch\">Honing The Pitch</h2>\n<p>To hone and sharpen the pitch, I wanted to answer two questions.</p><blockquote>\n<p>What is the 1 secret that I have?</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What is the single-line pitch that I can send to my mailing list, that will intrigue people to join NinjaPear?</p></blockquote>\n<p>It took almost two weeks to get to this section, so I will caveat to say that while these questions pointed me towards the direction that I am currently in, I am answering these questions in retrospect, after already coming up with a direction.</p><p>That said, my responses to the two questions are:</p><p><strong>Q: What is the 1 secret that I have?</strong></p><p>A: I was the CEO of Proxycurl. And the chief data procurement person then. I lived and breathed data. I know all about B2B data, how to get it at scale. So, my secret would be my know-how with B2B data. And I am not even referring to LinkedIn data.</p><p><strong>Q: What is the single-line pitch that I can send to my mailing list, that will intrigue people to join NinjaPear?</strong></p><p>A: “Hi Alex, would you be interested in a live chat widget that gives you 50 new lookalike B2B prospects for every new chat? Essentially you get 50 new leads for every live chat conversation you handle.”</p><h2 id=\"ninjapear-v02\">NinjaPear v0.2</h2>\n<p>This article took almost two weeks to complete because I really needed time to come up with a sharp-enough edge to market NinjaPear with, while remaining within the customer support/communication niche. One of the lessons I have also learnt is to not easily give up and to iterate persistently and keep shipping.</p><p>With that said, the next version of NinjaPear will remain a CX (customer experience) product, with a B2B data slant to it. The idea is NinjaPear will be a CX product that produces lookalike audiences from page visitors who initiate a live chat session; which in turn flips the script of customer support being a cost centre to that of it being a growth channel.</p><p>On top of that, we will begin building up a data moat, building a profile dataset of B2B professionals, their browsing habits, etc., which will only grow bigger as the product gets more entrenched with more companies using NinjaPear. In other words, the more people use NinjaPear, the more data we have about who is using what services, who they are (and how we can identify them). Then, businesses can choose how to prioritize each page visitor, and who else they can reach out to.</p><p>On top of that, I will bring a focus on revenue instead of market share. That means to say, no more free plans. There will be free tools such as a hosted Umami analytics, as well as various free APIs. But the core product will be gated by a subscription moving forward.</p><p>The product will also be dev-oriented.</p><p>Having this new iteration objective, I shall answer the PMF framework:</p><blockquote>\n<p>Who is the <em>target audience</em>?</p></blockquote>\n<p>B2B SMBs (SaaS) with a website, with developers.</p><p>CTOs/Product Leads in B2B SMBs.</p><blockquote>\n<p>Where can I find a community of such audience for which I’m able to <em>reach out to them individually, at scale</em>, to convert them to the product?</p></blockquote>\n<p>My mailing list that is 20K big. Although, it’ll be good if I can have a bigger list. I suspect that builtwith.com would provide a good amount of leads of customers already on a live chat service whom I might be able to convert. As well as the list of YC companies.</p><blockquote>\n<p>What <em>problem</em> is my product solving?</p></blockquote>\n<p>Companies don’t want to pay much for customer support. Instead, I will help companies make more money with customer support. The more support conversations, the more growth opportunities they will get.</p><blockquote>\n<p>How will I make my <em>first $100/mo</em>?</p></blockquote>\n<p>Firstly, I will stop offering any freebies. NinjaPear will be for paying users only, albeit with a very limited trial.</p><p>Then of course, I will send emails to my past customers asking them to give it a try.</p><blockquote>\n<p>What is the one secret that I have that allows me to <em>radically differentiate</em> my product from the others?</p></blockquote>\n<p>B2B Customer Data! I will generate lookalike audiences both on a company and personal level for any B2B businesses.</p><blockquote>\n<p>What is the <em>one-line pitch</em> that I can send to my audience/mailing list that will immediately intrigue them to try out the product?</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>“Hi Alex, would you be interested in a live chat widget that gives you 50 new lookalike B2B prospects for every new chat? Essentially you get 50 new leads for every live chat conversation you handle.”</em></p><blockquote>\n<p>Who would be the competitor that I want to beat?</p></blockquote>\n<p>Intercom.</p><h2 id=\"not-the-last-iteration\">Not the last iteration</h2>\n<p>This will not be the last NinjaPear iteration. The thing about PMF is that it is entirely based on hypotheses. What I have learnt in my life with regards to startup success so far is that:</p><ol>\n<li>Overnight successes take 10 years to happen.</li>\n<li>Success follows dogged persistence in <em>iteration</em>.</li>\n<li>My hypotheses might be wrong. I’m ready for it to be wrong for 10 years because I will continually iterate. I have time, experience, and some capital. Other companies do not.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The next step will be product planning and design.</p><p>Oh one more thing, I will not be building first this time. All I will be doing is to:</p><ol>\n<li>release a blog post.</li>\n<li>update the landing page to reflect the new product direction.</li>\n<li>send an email to my past customers and shill this new product.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And we’ll see how it goes.</p><p>I’m prepared for this to go wrong, so look out for my v0.3 PMF blog post.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>I have just launched <a href=\"https://nubela.co/blog/introducing-ninjapear/\">NinjaPear</a>. After the launch, I decided to dive headfirst into SEO marketing. After a considerable amount of time, I wrote and published <a href=\"https://nubela.co/blog/introducing-ninjapear/\">this article</a> with the intent to rank for the keyword “knowledge base software”. This article might or might not rank on Google after some time, <em>but</em> given that I published and had multiple articles rank for high value keywords during my time with Proxycurl and led a marketing team to continue this SEO growth trajectory, I think I know a thing or two about ranking.</p><p>It is simple to rank on Google, and there are no shortcuts. The secret is to be 10x better qualitatively relative to the ranked incumbents. In this article, I will break down how you can do this, with examples.</p><p>The SEO process is enshrined in this feedback loop:</p><ol>\n<li>Macro Keyword Research</li>\n<li>Keyword Prioritization (update or create new content)</li>\n<li>Micro Keyword Research</li>\n<li>Draft and publish content that is 10x qualitatively better</li>\n<li>Syndicate your content</li>\n<li>Track keywords</li>\n<li>(Go back to step 2)</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"getting-started\">Getting Started</h2>\n<p>To get started, you will need:</p><ol>\n<li>A <strong>blog</strong> (I recommend a Ghost blog – free as in open-sourced, and featureful!) You will need a blog because that is the primary home for which you will publish content.</li>\n<li>Your own <strong>domain</strong> (important). Always publish content on your own domain. Even better if it is a mature domain; that means something you have used for a while so it has history. Domain reputation matters. If you lack history/reputation on a domain, you can build it up over time.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Good to have but not necessary:</p><ul>\n<li>A good SEO tool that does things like keyword research and keyword rank tracking. Personally, I use Ahrefs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"1-macro-keyword-research\">1. Macro Keyword Research</h2>\n<p>The first step to SEO is to understand what keywords are relevant to your <em>target audience</em> (I am going to assume you know who your target audience is). I usually do that by studying my competitors, which I can do quite easily with Ahrefs:</p><ul>\n<li>Enter competitor’s website into SEO tool</li>\n<li>Study which non-branded organic intent keywords they are ranking for (ranked by keyword traffic volume). I’d add keywords that are relevant to my business/product to the list of keywords that I’d target.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I find that competing against a competitor helps me to focus my product vision remarkably. And the first step of the competition is to steal their readership away for any high-intent keywords that they are currently ranking for.</p><p>Anyways, do this for a couple of competitors you admire/wanna beat, and add keywords of interest into your SEO tool’s rank tracker.</p><h2 id=\"2-keyword-prioritization\">2. Keyword Prioritization</h2>\n<p>You should have a list of keywords that you wish to rank for. However, you got to understand you cannot do everything at a time. You have to work one article at a time (assuming you’re doing this alone). Therefore, you have to prioritize which keywords to work on first.</p><p>The parameters of consideration are:</p><ul>\n<li>Keyword difficulty (google it)</li>\n<li>Keyword Intent – if a user is googling this keyword, would this user likely be a user who might use your product? I’d give you two examples on intent:  * It is best not to rank for “free [xxx]”, and instead, rank for “best [xxx]” because users who are seeking free things are likely not to convert.  * It is better to rank for “live chat” instead of “sexy bikini” because the type of audience you will get for the latter would not be relevant to what you are selling.</li>\n<li>Traffic volume – if you rank for this keyword, how many users will see it anyway? The more the better.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ideally, you want a keyword with low keyword difficulty, high keyword intent and high traffic volume. A caveat is that as your domain reputation increases, you’ll find that you’ll be able to tackle keywords with high keyword difficulty.</p><p>That said, based on the parameters above, you will want to prioritize keywords for action.</p><h2 id=\"3-micro-keyword-research\">3. Micro Keyword Research</h2>\n<p>At this juncture, you should have a ranked list of keywords based on the keywords you want to work on. Now, you need to figure out what your competition is so you can build content that is 10x better! This is the straightforward part. Google the keyword you are targeting in an incognito window, and look at the top 10 results. This is your competition.</p><p>Click through each result, and read through every one of them and understand why they rank. Essentially, the top 10 results represent what the audience is looking for. Google has it all figured out. The question for this step is – after looking through the content that is ranked for the keyword you are targeting; how can you produce something that the user wants, but 10x better?</p><h2 id=\"4-draft-and-publish-content-that-is-10x-qualitatively-better\">4. Draft and publish content that is 10x qualitatively better</h2>\n<p>This is the crucial step in the entire process, and it’s a step that I do not have a proven process that will work every time. Only tips coupled with examples. At this step, you should have:</p><ol>\n<li>A keyword you are building the content for</li>\n<li>An understanding of what type of content users want</li>\n</ol>\n<p>With these in mind, you should begin brainstorming how you can produce content that is 10x qualitatively better.</p><p><strong>Understanding my competition and what users want</strong></p><p>To explain how to build 10x content, we’ll look at the “knowledge base software” keyword. A quick Google search shows that the top 2 results are “Top <code>N</code>.. Knowledge Base Software” articles. The 3rd ranking is a series of Reddit posts on knowledge base software. Then results of Knowledge Base solutions such as <em>Helpjuice</em> or <em>Slite</em> are sprinkled amongst the top 10 results. I understand now that users are looking for potential knowledge base solutions as well as reviews to help them decide which to use.</p><p>So I looked into the #1 ranked article from Slite which says Top 8 Knowledge Base Software. Which is essentially a quick review of 8 software plus its definition of what Knowledge Base software is.</p><p><strong>How I can do better</strong></p><p>I think I can do better. And I decided that I can do better by:</p><ol>\n<li>Providing a clear definition of Knowledge Base Software sorted by needs.</li>\n<li>Breaking down each product review with ⭐ ratings.</li>\n<li>Reviewing more products.</li>\n<li>Coming from a point of thought leadership.</li>\n<li>Providing a Google Sheet for a user as a usable material for comparing products</li>\n<li>Showing screenshots</li>\n<li>Being even more detailed, but not lengthy for the sake of being lengthy.</li>\n<li>Being opinionated</li>\n<li>Providing a punchy title</li>\n<li>Providing an interactive and useful widget</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now, if you look at <a href=\"https://nubela.co/blog/ultimate-guide-to-knowledge-base-software/\">https://nubela.co/blog/ultimate-guide-to-knowledge-base-software/</a>, that is exactly what I did.</p><p><strong>Provide a punchy title</strong></p><p>I want to come from a position of authority and thought leadership, so my title is:</p><blockquote>\n<p>The CEO’s Ultimate Guide to Knowledge Base Software (Demo, UI Preview, Reviews, Pricing)</p></blockquote>\n<p>Just by reading this title, you know you are in for something solid from someone of power. Compare this to the current top article’s title:</p><blockquote>\n<p>Top 8 Knowledge Base Software for 2025</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Be opinionated</strong></p><p>People want to read from works written by another human, not AI. And the thing about being human is having a bias. At no point in time, do I shy away from the fact that I’m the founder of NinjaPear which provides a Knowledge Base software. And I also sprinkle my opinions throughout the article with thoughts like:</p><blockquote>\n<p>However, as a serial entrepreneur, I’m not sure it is smart to place secrets, internal discussions, and anything proprietary into a 3rd-party platform which might hold you hostage unless you cough up more money. Like what Slack, Gitlab, or Google Workspace has done to us before.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Or me hating on Zendesk:</p><blockquote>\n<p>On top of that, its onboarding form’s UX is terrible and inefficient with one field per page. On top of that, it is super expensive. I really don’t understand why anyone would want to use Zendesk other than for legacy reasons.</p></blockquote>\n<p>People enjoy reading opinionated thoughts. Give it to them! We’re not robots. Stop acting like one.</p><p><strong>Be even more detailed, but not lengthy for the sake of being lengthy.</strong></p><p>The title speaks for itself. I write because I have something to say. I do not want to drone on about something just to fill up word count. Don’t ever do that. People will bounce away when what you are writing is boring and lengthy.</p><p>That said, it can be lengthy because it actually has a lot of details. And when this happens, let your users skip ahead. It is why I always include a table of contents so users can skip ahead.</p><p>On top of that, you will see that I created custom screenshot widgets. I have 6-15 screenshots for each product review. If I were to list every screenshot, the page would be <em>super</em> long and users would bounce. So, I encapsulated each product’s bunch of screenshots as a widget that a user can go through, expand if they want to, or skip it entirely if they are not interested.</p><p><strong>Show screenshots</strong></p><p>People are visual creatures. Tell them by showing. Every bug that I found was enshrined with a screenshot. This made my review so much more real.</p><p><strong>Provide a Google Sheet for a user as a usable material in comparing products</strong></p><p>Give your users a freebie. Something to download.</p><p><strong>Come from a point of thought leadership</strong></p><p>This is really important. The same article written by a marketing executive VS a CEO. Which one would you prefer to read? Of course the CEO. Which is why I write all the pivotal articles when I first launch a product. And I make sure I tell my audience that. This is authority.</p><p>Thought Leadership means that you are an expert in your field. Your audience would rather listen to an expert in the industry VS a CEO in a radically different industry.</p><p><strong>Review more products.</strong></p><p>Yes, it is more work. But your audience wants to be thorough. Do the work for them. Review more products.</p><p><strong>Break down each product review with ⭐ ratings.</strong></p><p>I find that providing numerical star ratings really shows the thought that a reviewer puts into reviewing a product. So do this to show that you put in the work in reviewing every aspect of a product.</p><p><strong>Providing a clear definition of Knowledge Base Software sorted by needs.</strong></p><p>This was a flaw that I found in most of the articles I saw about Knowledge Base software. Because knowledge base software is not made equally. Many of them solve different problems. Why do we lump them under a single category? So, I branched them into various segments. For customers VS for internal use; Technical knowledge VS Product knowledge. Etc. It all boils down to actually understanding the topic.</p><p><strong>Provide an interactive and useful widget</strong></p><p>This is really important and I found articles that included a useful and interactive widget performed much better from my time at Proxycurl. It improves interaction which I think Google likes, and it lets the user know that you are truly providing something of value. This is a must-have as much as possible.</p><p>Now, if you put all these iterative improvements together, they compound, and you get a 10x better piece of content.</p><h2 id=\"5-syndicate-your-content\">5. Syndicate your content</h2>\n<p>After posting your content, you got to seed your content with some audience/reach. What I’d recommend doing is to:</p><ul>\n<li>Share your content on various social media platforms:  * X  * LinkedIn  * Reddit  * Hacker News</li>\n<li>Syndicate it on other blog sites and make sure that there is a canonical tag  * Medium  * etc</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"6-track-keywords\">6. Track keywords</h2>\n<p>Once you are done publishing and syndicating the content piece, there is nothing you can do except to wait and hope for the best. You cannot do more. Just work on the next article. Volume of content matters because it is a numbers game. Pareto principle applies. 20% of your articles will rank and 80% will not regardless of your quality.</p><h2 id=\"content-as-product\">Content as Product</h2>\n<p>Lastly, I hope you see that content is another product in your company’s portfolio. Do it as well as your main product and you’ll see results.</p>",

It’s amazing for the most part, but also very broken in some areas, which Amara is refusing to rectify. I had already spent a few months chasing them regarding a very expensive house.

I was asked why I didn’t optimize my spending, especially since I had quite a fair bit of it, particularly if you include my corporate spend—all of which was made on my single debit card. And for a long time, I resisted it. I wanted the business class travels, but I could never get into the game of micro-optimizing my spending on multiple credit cards. I simply did not have the headroom for it.</p><h2 id=\"the-zero-sum-mindset\">The Zero-sum Mindset</h2>\n<p>There is a common thread tying both of these stories together. In both of these stories, I was tempted to give in to salvaging as much benefit as I could out of the status quo. But in both cases, I always eventually gave up on being the scrooge because there was a better way.</p><p>With Amara, which is still an ongoing story, I have simply decided that the costs to fix those issues would be &lt;$50,000. And I was expending patience and my time during business hours, and a good portion of my mental health trying to fight a stubborn bunch of unprofessional property developers. Civil proceedings would cost a lot more than the amount to recoup. So as of now, the decision is to ignore them and pay for the costs on my own, and recoup at least $20,000 of it through a claim via the small claims court. Because Amara would then be coerced to respond and properly fix things.</p><p>In the case of business class travels, I found it way easier to pay for it out of my own pocket for two reasons.</p><ol>\n<li>Business class flights available for redemption via miles are extremely limited. Miles redemption is its own game, separate from trying to win the miles collection game.</li>\n<li>My time is worth a lot more than the value I get out of miles.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That said, I started collecting miles by getting a lifestyle card, although at poor rates. But hey, at least I don’t spend my headspace trying to optimize for the maximum amount of miles I can collect.</p><p>For most people, they are stuck in a rat race because they are stuck in the zero-sum mindset. They feel that because they earn $X and it is so hard to earn $X+Y (where Y is the increment they need for a promotion), they therefore have to make the most out of whatever they earn or what they feel they rightly deserve. And they are not wrong. I 100% believe that Amara should be rectifying the defects that my house came with.</p><p>But, such a zero-sum mindset will lead to a zero-sum life.</p><h2 id=\"limited-mental-cycles\">Limited Mental Cycles</h2>\n<p>You see, we are nothing more than mortal animals with a big brain. Our energy is limited, as are our mental cycles and life span. I only have a few hours a day in which I am productive. I can either spend my mental cycles considering stupid things like how much more money to save, or working on things that have compounding growth, like businesses. And the right answer is almost always to spend time on things that have a growth trajectory that compounds. My point is, it is much much easier to make more money than to save money. Because there is an infinite amount of money you can earn, but only a limited amount of money to save.</p><p>Which is why I never try to save money. What I do instead is to make sure that my growth in monthly expenses does not surpass my rate of growth of income/revenue. I live the abundance mindset.</p><h2 id=\"the-abundance-mindset\">The Abundance Mindset</h2>\n<p>Adopting the abundance mindset means rejecting a life that is zero-sum by nature. And controversially, for most people, being an employee leads to a zero-sum outcome because your income is naturally limited by your hours and your boss. You are spending most (if not all) of your productive hours every work day for someone (like me) to grow their money generating (business) machine. While I’m not strictly against anyone being an employee (because it would be hypocritical of me, since I have historically hired so many), do consider being an employee as a stepping stone to eventually being an entrepreneur.</p><p>An abundance mindset means spending your limited timespan on things that compound in growth. And I promise you that if you live by the abundance mindset, sprinkle it with some luck, diligence, and intellect, you will never be poor.</p><p>I didn’t use to think this. But I don’t think I will ever be poor again in my life, like how I used to be growing up. And one of the key reasons is because I live and breathe the abundance mindset. And you should too, even if you are not motivated by money, because it is so much a better way to live life.</p>",
